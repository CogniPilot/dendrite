# Dendrite Fragment Database
#
# This file is no longer used for local fragment definitions.
# All HCDF fragments and models are fetched from hcdf.cognipilot.org
# and cached locally in fragments/cache/
#
# The daemon constructs URLs based on board/app:
#   https://hcdf.cognipilot.org/{board}/{app}/{app}.hcdf
#
# Cached files use symlinks for offline fallback:
#   fragments/cache/{board}/{app}.hcdf -> {sha}-{app}.hcdf
